Found issue with the CCS selector unable to Stretch out image or cover it fully.
Image didn't work properly so I've tired changing it, no-repeat works but everything else breaks the image into a Blank white slate.
Issue have beel solved by adding a Background-size:Cover to the text. Where I also rezised and recut the Original picture down in size to fit better.

All code have been written by myself, I've gone through the Love project and copied some of that code to my own and altered it to fit the theme of the page. Don't think I can provide an URL to specific codes considering I don't know where to find it. :P
